/**
 * 
 Partitions:

1-HTTP requests to /image endpoint with valid image name
2-HTTP requests to /image endpoint with invalid image name
3-HTTP requests to /index endpoint


Subdomains:

1-Valid image names:
a.solved
b. notsolved

2-Invalid image names:
a. Empty string
b. Non-existent image name


Test coverage:
* The test suite cover the  subdomains: valid_image, invalid_image.
* Each subdomain is tested with  test case that verifies the expected behavior
* 
Partition 1: HTTP request to /image endpoint with valid  image name returns expected image content
Partition 2: HTTP request to /image endpoint with invalid image name returns error message
Partition 2 : HTTP request to /image endpoint with empty image name returns error message
Partition 2 : HTTP request to /image endpoint with non-existent image name returns error message
Partition 3 : HTTP request to /index endpoint returns HTML page with links to the two images
Partition 3: HTML page returned by /index endpoint has correct image links and content
